quick_django_vagrant
====================

Introduction
------------

This project illustrates how to quickly create a `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ VM containing a typical `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ site. The idea is to be able to share sites without depending on complex provisioning tools.

Vagrantfile
-----------

The Vagrant configuration file has everything to set-up an Ubuntu virtual machine and provisioning the Django site using simple shell scripts, as described in `Vagrant's documentation <https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/shell.html>`_.

Feedback
--------

As usual, I welcome comments, suggestions and pull requests.
